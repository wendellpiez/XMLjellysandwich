title: A Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's Day (stanza one)
author: John Donne
date: published 1633
---

'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's,
Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks;[f1]
  The sun is spent, and now his flasks
  Send forth light squibs[f2], no constant rays;
    The world's whole sap is sunk;
The general balm th' hydroptic[f3] earth hath drunk,
Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk,
Dead and interr'd[f4]; yet all these seem to laugh,
Compar'd with me, who am their epitaph.

[[f1]] In northern latitudes the days can get very short around the winter solstice. St Lucy's Day -- in Europe, traditionally a festival of lights -- is celebrated December 13.

[[f2]] A squib might be a small firecracker, sparkler or other incendiary.

[[f3]] 'hydroptic': *hydropsis*, 'hydrops' or dropsy would be 'sore with water' or 'swollen': fluid retention.

[[f4]] 'interred': in the earth (*terra*). The poet shifts from making an observation about the earth (its having "drunk the general balm"), by way of the homely bed simile, to considering the earth of (or as) a metaphorical grave site.
